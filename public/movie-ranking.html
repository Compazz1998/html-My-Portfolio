<h1>My best movies of all time</h1>
<h4>I have seen a lot of interesting movies especially in the Hollywood. Below i will only be listing 3 out of the few i remember at the moment.</h4>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Apocalypto</h3>
<p>This movie`s storyline is top notch and it was just full of action scenes from beginning to the ending. As funny as it may sound i liked this movie more for the simple fact that it was acted in the bush lol.</p>

<h3>2. Hard Target</h3>
<p>It`s even more interesting to know that the major character in this movie is one of my favorites in the Hollywood industry(Jean Claude Van Damn).The movie is also action filled and i liked how he took revenge on the villain.</p>

<h3>3. No retreat no surrender</h3>
<p>It`s now been more than 10 years since i watched this movie and the scenes still play in my head like its yesterday. The plot of the movie entails two brothers whose father was assassinated in his home. They plotted a revenge mission and executed it in a cool and action filled way.</p>
